        I create successful websites that are fast, easy to use,
        and built with best practices.

      <p class="container__text">
        I am a visual designer and web developer with passion
        for creating an interactive, useful, and delightful user
        experience. As a designer, I enjoy solving complex
        problems by using a holistic design process with a focus
        on multi-disciplinary collaboration and rapid iteration.
      </p>

      <p class="container__text">
        My skills are broad: from <strong>frontend</strong> and
        backend development to <strong>UX/UI</strong> and
        <strong>graphic design</strong>, I enjoy each aspect,
        and love building sites and mobile apps from start to
        finish, for clients all over the world.
      </p>

      <p class="container__text">
        I value simple
        <strong>
          content structure, clean design patterns and
          thoughtful interactions</strong
        >. My past experience is in visual design but I also
        have a passion for frontend development which is what I
        am currently working in. Given that producing a modern
        website requires the combination of design, technology,
        and an user-centered design process, I believe having
        experience in both design and development allows me to
        make the most optimal products.
      </p>

      <p class="container__text">
        While most of my attention is on interactive projects, I
        also do branding from time to time. This includes logo
        design, business cards, and other printed materials.
        Lately I am very interested in UI/UX design and I spend
        my time learning about wireframes, sitemaps and user
        experience design which I put to good use on every
        project I work on.
